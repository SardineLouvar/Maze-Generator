# Maze-Generator
The following python code generates a maze of a desired size as well as its solution.

To run the code, ensure that mazegenmod and Main are in the same folder, then just run the Main.py file.

The maze is generated using a recursive backtracking algorithm, then the solution is found with a depth-first search.

Examples below:
